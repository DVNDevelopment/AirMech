<2><W>AirMech FAQ and other Notes:<>
<W>_______________________________________________<>

<3><W>How do I choose my AirMech and Units?<>

The Hangar tab at the top of the main menu will allow you to customize your Loadout. You can choose your AirMech class with the orange box at the top left, and select its cosmetics below. To the right of the AirMech image, you can equip parts to modify your Mech's stats. On the right side of the Hangar, choose your Pilot, Item, Units and Guardian. 

<W>InvaderMEEN<> over at <W>MOBA Monster<> made a nice guide for new players to check out and answer this exact question. Give it a read!

<3><W>How do I become awesome at AirMech?<>

You should watch <W>areyouwhy's<> amazing videos with commentary. It's almost like cheating to watch these, because you learn tricks from the pros who have spent hundreds of hours practicing. I'm surprised they even let people see this stuff! It's a lot of fun to watch too: <.l>http://www.youtube.com/areyouwhy0x<.>.


<3><W>What are 'Diamonds' and/or 'Kudos' and how do I acquire them?<>

Kudos are points that you earn by playing and completing games and/or finishing <.x>quests<.>. You can use kudos to purchase items, mechs, and units.

Diamonds are purchased via real world currency and can be used to unlock cosmetic adjustments to your mechs. You can find the diamond bundles by clicking the <.x>diamonds<.> icon at the top right of the main menu.

Nothing that impacts your in-game ability vs other players will ever be available using only diamonds. In short, we do not and have no plans to ever do the 'Pay to Win' model.

You can also earn diamonds by referring other players and completing the <.x>Referral<.> quests in the 'Social' category of your Quest Log. When one of your referrals makes their first purchase, you'll get 10% of their diamonds (1000 diamonds if they get Prime) as a bonus! Your referrals must hit level 10 to qualify for quests. You can share this <.x>Referral Link<.> with your friends to help them create a new AirMech account.


<3><W>How do I use the Player Market to buy and sell stuff?<>

Want to watch a guided overview of the whole thing? <W>Exophic<> made a great video explaining it: <.l>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7qvg-LxcU<.>. Watch it!

First, you need to reach level 5 to buy and level 10 to sell (or have VIP status), and agree to the Market terms of use. Non-VIP sellers have a higher tax rate. Taxes are applied to the final sale amount and paid by the buyer. VIP players have a greatly reduced tax rate and the ability to further lower this rate by using tax books. 

To list an item on the Player Market, right-click on the item in your Inventory, then click the Market List button at the bottom right. You can then set the price you want to list the item at, the amount of time until the listing expires, who the listing is available to, and how you want to pay the listing fee. Double check all fields and click OK, Create Listing to finalize your listing.

We do not "fix" things that are sold or bought by accident! We may in some cases punish scammers, but it is also up to players to not do "trades" for under normal value. If something sounds too good to be true, it always is. We do not return items lost this way in the market. Trading will be coming in the future, and at that time it will be safer to trade with other players. Until that time, we only support listing items at the full market price. This is the only way to avoid being scammed by other players.

<3><W>What is Diamond VIP and how do I get it?<>

<W>Diamond VIP<> is a new reward for players who have spent more than $120 USD over the lifetime of their account. We discovered that a growing number of players have spent quite a bit, and we wanted to do a little something to say "thank you" and give them some recognition. Because we've had different bundles offered and different prices since early Alpha, we figured the most fair way was the total spent instead of things you own, so if you didn't get something on sale at least that full amount counts towards Diamond VIP progress.

What do you get with Diamond VIP? The most obvious thing is the chat badge, which can be enabled by going to your Inventory, hover your cursor over the checkmark in the top right, then select the Badges filter. You can then drag the badge you want over to the chat window. You will also have a new Weekly Quest similar to Daily Login where you get a <.E>VIP Shop Ticket<.>. It can be used to buy a selection of off-season items (some things are not available) at full price. This reward was chosen because most of the Diamond VIPs are collectors, and this assists them in completing their collections. A <.E>DVIP Club Card<.> is also awarded, which grants a new, unreleased cosmetic item each month. These rewards may be awarded at login or via gamemail.

Think you qualify for Diamond VIP but you don't see the status upgrade? There is an issue with how some purchases from Steam are tracked, for example if you bought the Soundtrack from Steam directly they tell us that you own it, but not what you paid for it. So it creates a small problem for us to track currently. We're working on a solution, but if you are confident that your total should be over $120 then you can email <W>support@carbongames.com<> and ask us to review your account.


<3><W>Will there be a "wipe" or "reset" after beta?<>

No. Everything you earn or purchase in AirMech is yours to keep.


<3><W>I stopped earning Kudos/XP, what happened?<>

Currently we only allow players to earn rewards for the first 6 hours of offline play each day, resetting every 22 hours. Want unlimited Solo play? Purchase the <.E>Starter Pack<.> or <.E>AirMech Prime<.> (both come with VIP) and never worry about this time limit again.


<3><W>How can I build more things in my Basecamp?<>

First, you'll need to clear an empty plot of land using a <.E>Shovel<.>. You can purchase additional Shovels from the 'Other' section of the Shop. Once you have a Shovel, click on the empty plot to clear it out. If you've run out of empty plots to build on, don't worry! More plots will become available as you level up. Once you've cleared some land, you'll need a blueprint to construct your building. These can also be found in the 'Other' section of the Shop. Click on an empty plot to build a structure from your available blueprints.

Some blueprints have restrictions such as requiring VIP or Prime to purchase. These structures are not required, but offer handy shortcuts to other features. Some blueprints will only be sold for diamonds. This indicates that the building is most likely a cosmetic-only structure. If the structure is useful to players, it will always have a kudos price.


<3><W>I have two AirMech accounts. How do I combine them?<>

Unfortunately you cannot combine two AirMech accounts. You may attach a new login or email address to an existing account but only if there has not been a username created for that identity. For example, if you are a Steam user and want to add an email or a Google account to play the Chrome or (upcoming) Android version and keep all of your stuff, you can do that here: <.l>https://carbongames.com/link.html<.>.


<3><W>What do the different colored names mean?<>

Colors: <Nn>New player<>, <Nl>Level 1-9<>, <Nm>Level 10-29<>, <Nh>Level 30-59<>, <NM>Level 60-99<>, <NU>Level 100+<>, <O>Moderator, Carbon Dev, or Chat Bot<>


<3><W>How do I join a game?<>

There are several types of games you can play, and they are all located under the 'Play' tab which is at the top left of the main menu.

Several game types are available to you in matchmaking. Give them all a try and figure out where you have the most fun. You may need to complete a few Coop games before PvP modes are unlocked.


<3><W>How do I add a player to my friends list?<>

If you see your friend in chat, click on their name, then click <W>Send Friend Invite<>. If you know your friend's username, you can type <W>/addfriend username<> into Global chat. The Friends List can also be used to add new friends by typing their name into the search box.


<3><W>What is the 'best' loadout to start with?<>

This is one of those questions that will elicit a different answer from each person you ask it to. This is because there is no 'best' build. There are builds that are good for different situations but bad for others, and vise versa. The units we have in your loadout by default are what we believe make the game the easiest to learn when you first start, in addition to being well rounded enough that you can keep playing with them if you like.


<3><W>What does my AirMech level do?<>

Each AirMech class has it's own level progression once you've unlocked the basic model. The same XP you gain at the end of a match is also applied to the AirMech class you used in that match. Increasing your AirMech level allows you to equip more powerful parts. Each mech can reach a maximum of level 20.


<3><W>How do I select multiple units?<>

While in the air and not holding any cargo, you can hold Ctrl or <:C> while flying over your units to select them. You can then give them the Attack, Capture, or Hold command.


<3><W>What do all the unit 'Orders' do?<>

Keeping in mind that orders do not work on standard infantry, here is a breakdown of what each order does (The letter to the left being the key you must press to give the 'order' once you have picked up a unit):

T / <:U> - This will command your unit to '<W>Capture<>' the nearest outpost. Once at the outpost, will prioritize enemy units as targets before attacking the outpost itself. After the outpost is neutralized, the unit will then defend the outpost until receiving new orders.

F / <:D> - The '<W>Follow<>' order will link your unit to the nearest unit you have on the ground, following and protecting it until that unit is destroyed.

G / <:R> - The '<W>Patrol<>' order will allow you to set a patrol path for your unit. To set points for the unit to patrol, pick up the unit, hold down Shift, then right click on each location you would like your unit to patrol between. After you have selected the patrol points, simply press 'G' again to start the patrol. Note that the location you drop the unit at counts as a patrol point so be careful where you are setting your unit down at.

Y / <:L> - This order will command your unit to ‘<W>Attack<>' the enemy Fortress. The unit will attack along the way if able, but will not stop until it reaches its destination. Upon arriving at the Fortress, the unit will only attack the Fortress until receiving new orders or destroyed.

C / <:C> - This order will command your unit to ‘<W>Hold<>’ position. The unit will continue to defend its position until receiving new orders or destroyed.


<3><W>Why do some units have two DPS numbers?<>

This is for units that have a reload time between firing cycles. The first number is the DPS of the unit while firing. The second number in parenthesis is the sustained DPS after reload time is calculated in. For example, <.u>Jackal<.> does 120 DPS for four seconds and then pauses to reload for two seconds. With the two seconds of reload time factored in, the sustained DPS is 80.


<3><W>Are there any additional resources to help me get better at the game beyond the tutorial?<>

We are currently working on improving the tutorial and challenge portions of the game to allow players a chance to both learn the game and further hone their skills. For now though, you can play co-op vs ai games to better improve your understanding of units and mechs before you take your skills to battle against other players. You can also watch other players play the game via the 'Watch' tab at the top of the screen.

If you have a specific question, always feel free to ask in chat. We have a pretty good community full of very helpful and friendly people.


<3><W>What do colored tracers do?<>

Aside from look really freaking cool? Nothing. Colored tracers are simply an alternate color for your AirMech's gun fire.


<3><W>I frequently lag in games. How can I prevent this?<>

There are various factors that could contribute to lag. The most common of these in AirMech is playing on a server that is not near you. You can refresh your list of available servers by typing <W>/latency<> in chat. You’ll see the message “Latency data has been updated.” when it’s complete. You can also view your latency data for all of our game servers by clicking the Locations button from the Watch menu.

Aside from that, downloading anything while you are trying to play an online game is never a good idea. Try pausing any downloads or bandwidth intensive sites that require you to buffer audio/video like Youtube or even some music streaming sites depending on your connection.


<3><W>Where can I go to help Carbon test new patches when they are released?<>

When we release patches, we first promote them to a 'test' build to make sure nothing is broken. This build is called 'Canary'. We announce when we are releasing a new Canary by displaying a yellow banner above chat with a Canary Bird on the AirMech logo. When you see it, check the forums for a new Canary thread.

We often use the AirMech Steam group chat to coordinate testing. To get to the group chat, navigate to AirMech in your Steam library. Right click on AirMech and select "View Game Hub". In the upper right of the page this brings you to you should see  'X in Group Chat' in white letters. Just click on the underlined 'Group Chat' to join the conversation.

More information about Canary can be found at <.l>airme.ch/CanaryInfo<.>


<3><W>What does OP mean?<>

Usually it means "over powered". It can be serious when discussing balance, or used as a joke for very weak things. If you're not familiar with the game it might take a bit of time to understand when people are serious and when they are joking. It can also be used to describe a player as a compliment. Since the only difference between players is skill, if you call someone OP you are saying their skill is so high that it is unfair for them to compete against "normal" players.


<3><W>Why is everything boblan's fault?<>

Why is the sky blue? Why does the sun rise? Why did the chicken cross the road?

No matter the answer, the outcome remains the same. The sky is still blue, the sun still rises, the chicken still crossed the road, and it is and always will be boblan's fault.
