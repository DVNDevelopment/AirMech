<3>Update #229 - Build 47851 June 20th, 2016<>
<2><W>Optional Deploy Arm<>

We've renamed many of our game modes this patch. Skirmish is now Versus, while Survival mode will now be known as Warzone. Feedback on the <.x>forums<.> generally agreed that Ranked and Unranked were misleading names, so we've renamed those to Skills and Unlimited respectively. The descriptions for all of these queues have been updated as well.

Your feedback on the <.x>forums<.> is always important to us, even when we don't respond right away. Since so many of you have asked for it, we've added a setting in General -> Gameplay for "Deploy Arm Enabled". This will be on by default, since it's intended for advanced users rather than new players. You can change this setting at any time, even during a multiplayer match. Turning the deploy arm off will prevent your units from being automatically deployed. They'll be stored in the structure they were built at and can be picked up by AirMechs above the structure. This brings back a popular strategy of hiding units in queue, but it can be countered by neutralizing the outpost they're queued at.

<BG>General Updates:<>
- added an option to disable the deploy arm and manually pick up units from structures
- renamed some game modes and updated Play menu with new tooltips

- tweaks to the endgame victory medal
- added some variation to <.a>Striker<.> sword audio
- set a limit for credit cap messages to reduce spam
- added pilot icons for in-game messages
- added icons for trials in the pregame lobby

<BG>Bug Fixes:<>

- fix for the Link command on units with a deploy animation delay
- fix for melee units not attacking enemy fortress when no capture targets are available
- fixed a bug with flier separation not applying to neutral units

<3>Update #228 - Build 46945 May 26th, 2016<>
<2><W>Editor Updates and PvE Work<>

It's been awhile since our last update. A lot of changes have been made that focus on PvE and story content. Most of that work is not yet ready for release, but you'll still notice some small things here and there. Neutral units have been claimed by an unknown force, but they haven't revealed themselves just yet. New promos, dialogs, and in-game messages may also hint at some of the things to come.

Since we're working on new maps focused on PvE, we needed to make some more improvements to the Map Editor to support some more advanced scripting. Many new conditions and actions were added, and we can't wait to see what kind of custom maps you'll build with them. We're also going to enable scripts to run on any game mode, so you don't have to set the map to Custom. Some features requested on the <.x>forums<.> have made their way into the Editor, such as a facing/rotation property for spawned units, box select will now filter its selection with an option to select everything by holding Shift, confirm dialogs for New and Publish options, and new UI for publishing maps. Give it a try and let us know if you run into any issues or have suggestions for Map Editor features.

<3>Update #227 - Build 45132 April 8th, 2016<>
<2><W><>

This update comes with some important fixes to the patching process of AirMech. We'd like to know if anyone is still having trouble updating, even on the Canary version. If you're using Steam, this probably won't affect you.

The Map Editor is getting more attention this week as we've added a couple of requested features and fixed a few bugs. We've also added player-facing error messages for map publishing. This will help us track down the issues that some players are experiencing when trying to share their creations. Post on the <.x>forums<.> if you run into one of these errors and we'll try to get these sorted out.

<.M>Crater<.> will be getting some cosmetic attention this patch. While working on the VR version of AirMech, many of our maps needed some touch-up work here and there, particularly around the edges. We'll be merging some of these improvements into the PC version going forward. Crater is first on the list!

<3>Update #226.1 - Build 44688 March 17th, 2016<>
<2><W>Mini-Patch<>

Our last patch included some network changes that needed to be tested. The results were looking good until we ran into a bug that prevented players from starting games. Those changes were disabled after a few days while we worked on some fixes. We'll be monitoring the changes again with this patch, but we'd love to get more feedback from you on the <.x>forums<.>!

Some other changes have made their way in since out last patch. We've had requests on the forums to add a way to reset the positions of your Ability/Unit bars and minimap. We've added a button to the General Settings to do this, but you can also manually move them around with your mouse cursor while holding U. Some of the Items have also been changed to reduce the duplicate stats or to put them on par with other Items that have similar stats.

We've also decided to include Honor in Ranked PvP matches. You'll gain two Honor for a Ranked win, but you'll also gain one Honor for a loss. We'll be using Honor for more things in the future, but you can already unlock a few new things from the Shop with it.

Discuss this patch on the forums: <.l>http://airme.ch/1px0yic<.>

<BG>General Updates:<>

<3>Update #226 - Build 44314 March 8th, 2016<>
<2><W><>

We've got a big patch to catch you up on the latest updates and fixes. There have been a ton of performance optimizations and improvements to the game engine since our last patch. Among these improvements are some fixes to the net code which we'll be monitoring for a while. Please don't hesitate to let us know how things feel in online matches. The <.x>forums<.> are the best place to communicate with us.

We've also got another round of AI fixes with some tweaks to the lower difficulty settings. Veteran players may even be surprised by how much they've improved. Give it a try and look for the daily <.x>Quests<.> to earn some extra rewards by playing with friends. With all these bug fixes the AI becomes more powerful in ways that are hard to foresee. It's good to hear back from players that find it too difficult.

Speaking of feedback, we noticed some complaints about the XP grind for leveling up your AirMechs for better parts. We've made to changes to address this. The first is that the XP you gain at the end of a match is increased by 50% before it's applied to the AirMech you used. This change went into effect about a month ago. The other half was to decrease the amount of XP needed to reach each level. Since this part required a patch to go live, some of your AirMechs may have already increased in level!

<W>_________________________________<>
<3>Update #225 - Build 42574 January 29th, 2016<>
<2><W>Pregame Tweaks and New Parts!<>

We've made some adjustments to the pregame phase that should fit better with the new unit deployment rules. Neutral units can no longer be damaged before the timer expires. This gives players more time to setup without worrying about getting behind on clearing neutrals for maps such as <.M>Twin Peaks<.>. We've also enabled XP awards for building units in pregame. We didn't want to open doors for XP farming in pregame, so we've also reduced recycling returns down to 75% of the unit's value.

There are a ton of new parts and a few new items with this patch. The new items are available in the Shop, while the new parts have been added to the endgame drops. Still looking for some of the old parts? We're going to allow all parts that are not sold in the Shop to be sold on the Player Market instead. Since we're adding in Mk4 versions of our Helmet, Knee, and Chest Armor parts, we're going to be renaming the Heavy versions to include Mk2. This change won't be noticeable at first, since it will require some server-side updates to complete the renaming process.

There are a few more improvements worth mentioning. We've always had complaints about the bridges in front of the forts on maps like <.M>Thar<.> and <.M>Dust<.>. Units will now move in much closer to the enemy fortress while on the Attack order. This should prevent the units in the back of a push from being blocked, and allow them to move within range. As requested on the <.x>forums<.>, we've also increased the limit on custom paths allowed. You can now have up to 6 paths drawn at a time! For more info, be sure to check out the details below. Discuss this update at <.l>http://airme.ch/1NGwtAA<.>

<BG>General Updates:<>
- <.a>Super Helix<.> added to the Shop
- added five new Items to the Shop: <.i>Holdout Pistol<.>, <.i>Stim Kit<.>, <.i>Survival Knife<.>, <.i>Fuzzy Dice<.>, and <.i>Pilot's Buckle<.>

<3>Update #224 - Build 41947 January 12th, 2016<>
<2><W>Requested Features and Bug Fixes<>

As requested by players on the forums, we've added two new keybinds for manually selecting which structure your build orders will go to. "Set Build Point" can be used to select the closest structure to your AirMech. Press it again to deselect the structure and go back to the default behavior. "Cycle Build Location" will cycle through each friendly structure, starting with the fortress and then closest to farthest outpost. This will allow controller players to select an outpost without having to move closer. You can find these keybinds in the Building section of the Controls Settings.

Another popular request has been the ability to move the in-game UI bits around. We've decided to try this out and have a first pass implemented in this build. "Adjust Game UI" can be found in the Other section of the Controls Settings and is bound to U by default. While holding the hotkey, you can click and drag the minimap and unit/ability bars at the bottom.

Command Mode is a new keybind that allows you to use the mouse cursor for group select functions. While holding the hotkey, shooting and ability functions are disabled on the mouse. You can then use it to click on individual units to add them to the group. Click and drag to box select units in an area. Double-clicking a unit will select all units of that type (within group select range), while double-clicking the terrain will deselect all units. You can also use Command Mode to select a structure as your build location. We'd like to get some feedback on this and ideas to expand on.

<BG>General Updates:<>
- <.a>Super Striker<.> is now available for purchase from the Shop

- first pass at moveable UI elements in-game with Adjust Game UI keybind

- adjusted the defensive turret count and push size of AirMech AI based on difficulty

<W>_________________________________<>
<3>Update #223 - Build 41128 December 5th, 2015<>
<2><W>New Unit Deployment System<>

We're finally ready to roll out the new unit deployment system. With this new system, units can no longer be pulled from the top of the outpost. Instead, your units will be placed around the outpost by a deploy arm. Offensive and repair units will be deployed in the front (closest to the enemy Fortress) while support units are placed in the back. This also means that units will need to be queued at the specific outpost that you want them to be deployed from. When queuing units, you'll notice particles being emitted from your mech that will travel to the closest friendly structure. A gear icon will appear over units queued at the structure you're closest to. You can also queue units at multiple structures at once to speed up production.

One major benefit of this system is that units can no longer be held in queue. Everything will be out on the field, so scouting is much more productive and accurate. Now you can push out your units with confidence knowing that your opponent can't magically pull out 6 Grinders they've been saving up to counter your push. It also means that outpost cheeses are a bit harder to pull off. You'll need to bring units to defend your new outpost, rather than pulling out whatever was in your queue at the time.

Pilot stats have changed quite a bit with this update. The 12 core pilots each represent a different archetype, with the seasonal pilots becoming alternates of core pilots. You'll never have to wait for a particular event to obtain the pilot that fits your playstyle. We may tweak the pilots to find the right balance over the next few weeks, so please be patient and send us your feedback on the forums!

You may have noticed the level up dialog mentions earning Pilot Points. This is a new system for training your pilot's stats via the Basecamp. You'll earn 5 points per level (retroactive for previous levels) which can be spent on any pilot you own. Additional points can also be purchased with kudos. Each stat modifier is weighted differently, and upgraded separately from other pilots that use the same stat mod. PvP players should not be alarmed, as pilot training will not affect Ranked PvP (just like parts).

There are a few changes to the Player Market that will affect everyone. The base tax rate for VIP players has been changed to 17%, which brings the minimum tax to 5% after all books have been used. Non-VIPs will now be able to make purchases from the Market at level 5, and list items at level 10. There will be no locked diamond penalties for non-VIP sellers. To make up for this, the tax rate for non-VIPs has been increased to 35%, and the ability to use tax books has been removed. As always, making a purchase and becoming VIP will instantly remove these restrictions.


There's also a long list of new features and bug fixes to be found below. Range indicators were added for many units (you can disable these in the General Settings), icons for parts that indicate the type and AirMech class, updates to AI AirMechs, and some new Map Editor features, just to name a few.

Discuss this update on the forums at <.l>http://airme.ch/1YRn55s<.>

<3>Update #221 - Build 40021 October 29th, 2015<>
<2><W>Happy Halloween!<>

We made it just in time for Halloween, and made a special Name Your Price bundle to help you celebrate with some new flair! The Halloween Bundle includes <W>4500<> diamonds and <W>10,000<> kudos for whatever price you want. If you beat the current average price, you'll also receive a <.f>Ghost Gigi<.> and <.m>Halloween Crate<.> (<.m>Key<.> included). 

This update isn't just about Halloween. We've got many big changes you'll notice as soon as you jump into a match. For starters, your AirMech abilities will no longer be built and picked up at structures. You'll be able to upgrade them instantly with ability points earned with each level-up. We're also raising the in-game level cap from 15 to 20! This will allow you to fully upgrade most of your abilities at max level, but not all of them. Choose wisely!

What does this mean for Guardians? Since Guardians can be destroyed or lost, we've added an automatic respawn timer to rebuild them. When your AirMech is destroyed or a Guardian is shot down, it will take 30 seconds for each Guardian you've unlocked.

To top things off, we're throwing a new skin into the <.E>Fall Crate<.> -- the <.a>Raptor Neo<.>. Don't forget to the Shop to find the <.u>Ultimate Boxer<.>, as well as all your favorite Halloween event items for a limited time!

<2><W>Pirate Week and Bonus Diamonds!<>

Avast! It's a Pirate life for me! ...and you! For one week only we have a mess of Pirate themed goodies. Pet Parrots and Pirate Hats and...Pirate Treasure! The <.E>Pirate Crate<.> is a prize indeed and far from a common crate. Inside lies very valuable loot! Diamonds, or lots of Diamonds? Or even the legendary <.E>Gold Parrot<.> if you are that lucky!

There's a very special Blueprint in the Shop related to Pirate Week. It's the <.E>Shipwreck<.>, which will allow you to uncover this magnificent lost galleon--right in your own camp! On its own it would make a wonderful centerpiece to brag about, but during our Pirate Week it has a special function. Once per day, you can search it and there's an excellent chance you will find a Pirate Crate! To maximize this benefit, make sure to collect it every day for the next week, as when the event ends it will stop producing Pirate Crates...until next year.

These <.E>Pirate Crates<.> are not like normal crates, as pirates are not very trusting types. They require a special Key to unlock...the <.E>Skeleton Key<.>. You can craft one using a Skull and a Key in the Nanoforge, or you can buy one directly from the Shop. If you take a peek at the loot inside the Pirate Crate I think you'll see why it requires such a special key.

It's also been a while since we've done Bonus Diamonds, and since Pirates do love treasure this is an excellent time to do one! All Diamond Pack purchases will get an extra 25% Diamonds instantly! And yes, you get more Diamonds as a referral bonus too, we wouldn't forget about that. 

Discuss this update in the forums: <.l>http://airme.ch/update219<.>

<3>Update #219.0 - Build 38859 September 19th, 2015<>
<2><W>Ultimate Parts, Level Based Parts, Balance Changes<>

Starting this patch you'll notice some big changes--your AirMechs can now continue to level up to a cap of 20. And the Part Points have actually been removed--we've made a major balance pass on Parts, and decided to make them level based instead. This greatly simplifies selecting Parts--just pick the most powerful ones that you are high enough level to equip.

There has also been a huge balance rework of the Parts to take this new system into account. Many Parts simply have one or two positive stats, and no negatives. No more stressing out of over what Parts to equip and the overall effect on your mech. This goes along with us removing Parts from Ranked PvP (at least for now) while we experiment with progression and balance. 

Ultimate Parts...you've been asking for more Ultimate AirMechs, and this is our answer to that. Now you can pick any skin you want and make it Ultimate! Unless you are using an Aura, your mech will get the Ultimate glow if any Ultimate Parts are equipped. This also means that the Ultimate Striker and Ultimate Helix have been converted into Super Striker and Super Helix. For each one of those you own, you will find you have the new skin plus 5 Ultimate Parts in it's place. (and yes, you'll soon be able to sell them) After the transition we'll make them available to all players in the game Shop.

Two really nice gameplay additions this patch are the drop direction indicator and respawn timer. When carrying a unit, you'll now see a circle with a point on it which faces your mouse cursor direction. When you drop a unit, it will face in this direction--no more needing to shoot in empty space just to aim units! Your tanks will thank you when placing them on the front lines. The respawn timer for each player is shown over their AirMech type in the hud. A small but welcome change to many!

More Ultimates have been balanced since last patch, and this continues to be ongoing work. We've also made all AirMechs get stronger as they level up. Just a bit per level, but max level AirMechs should feel more powerful and be more of a deciding factor toward the end of the game--at least that's the plan, let us know how it works out.

<3>Update #218 - Build 38604 September 11th, 2015<>
<2><W>Megaton Update<>

This update is something big, really big. It didn't actually start out that way, but we have had a lot of different systems we've been working on for a long time and they just happened to all come together around the same time. There's a lot to cover, so let's get to it.

<2><W>Upload Custom Maps<>

You are now able to Publish maps from the editor and they will be added to a public map list. Anyone can play these maps currently, as we're still trying to decide if any restrictions should be put on them for new/free players. For now, have fun and enjoy, and leave feedback on what you think.

Publishing has been working for the past few days actually, and if you have the test build of the game you've been able to see player made maps inside the game. We've had a ton of fun playing these maps! I'm super excited to see how this evolves, as already in a very short time it has added something new and fresh to the game.

Currently you need Prime to Publish maps. We're going to let anyone with Silver VIP use the editor while we are in this testing phase, then decide what to do later. Also anyone can play Custom Maps for now, we may or may not want to restrict this to VIPs. Honestly we don't know, we're just going to see who plays what and listen to feedback, so let us know what you think about all this and how to charge for it.

There's also a ton of improvements made to the Map Editor itself, too much to get into here. Come find all the info on the forums!

<2><W>Ultimates Rebalancing<>

When we originally created Ultimates, we just made them insanely powerful. And that's fun to a certain degree, but with more and more Ultimates it ends up removing any challenge at all. We've decided to do a major rebalance and bring Ultimates down to 10 to 20% better than their normal versions. They are absolutely the most powerful versions of units/items, but not in a crazy way.

We're also going to soon be removing Ultimate AirMechs. We'll be replacing them with Ultimate Parts, so you can make any AirMech Variant Ultimate. They will get the Ultimate aura if you have any of these special parts equipped. For the current Ultimate AirMechs, we'll be converting them to "Super" Variants and simply be cool skins, and you'll get a batch of Ultimate Parts for free.

And with a rebalance of Ultimates, it lets us put...

<2><W>Ultimates in Unranked Games<>

We've decided to remove the dedicated Ultimate queue and instead just allow Ultimates in Unranked games. Since they don't affect your record anyway, there's no harm if you come up against an opponent using Ultimates. In fact, we wanted to take this even further, and provide special rewards for both winning against those using Ultimates, and even if you lose you should be rewarded for fighting against a stronger enemy with our new...

<2><W>Honor System<>

Shortly after we patch, we will be rolling out the new Honor System. This is our way of taking a look at the balance of a particular matchup, and deciding if extra recognition is needed. We take the total number of Ultimate Points your opponents are using, and use that plus some other data to determine how many Honor Points you will be awarded. We think this will be between 1 and 3 per game.

We will also be awarding a small amount of Honor for winning Ranked games. You won't get any Honor for losing a Ranked PvP match, as it should be evenly matched. We've actually gone a step further and while we are testing changes to the balance of Ultimates and Parts, we're making Parts do nothing in Ranked PvP matches. (Ultimates are of course banned from Ranked games as always)

100 Honor Points will unlock the first Honor Badge, and that badge allows you to buy sweet exclusive rewards like the <.E>Bronze Helmet<.>. We'll have exclusive Basecamp structures, cosmetics, and other perks. Honor things will be player bound and not able to be sold or traded of course.

Speaking of PvP, we've also made quite a few changes to the menus there...

<2>PvP Menu Rework<W>

The PvP menus have been reworked to accommodate some changes to Ranked and Unranked play. PvP will have 3 game types: Ranked, Unranked, and Custom. Currently we have removed 3v3 lobbies so we can focus on 2v2 which we feel is the most balanced way to play the game.

If you want to play 3v3, you can still create a Custom game at the bottom of the PvP menu. In fact, you should really check out the new Custom games where you can…

<2>Play Custom Maps!<W>

You can now play maps Published by other players! We can't say for sure that what you will find in the player made maps will be balanced, or finished--or even work right--but we've already had a ton of fun playing maps that you all have uploaded.

We expect there will be some bugs, but this is our "alpha" release of the ability to play maps made by other players without having to jump through hoops of copying files around by hand. Want to see more maps made by a player? Right click their name in the list of maps, it should show you all the maps they have Published.

<3>Update #215 - Build 37660 August 6th, 2015<>
<2><W>Shop, Market, Bugs and Balance<>

We are giving the Shop and Market a big overhaul to make it easier to browse and find what you want. We've gone back to a more traditional menu that you can expand and sort. There's a few things left to finish (some new filters needed) but in general it's going in the right direction.

Dan has spent a lot of time with the map editor fixing bugs and adding features. Still not what we would call beta, but in it's alpha state it can be fun to mess around with. We've also released a special Basecamp structure that gives you a shortcut into the editor, plus it's kind of a fun extra for your camp. Look for it in the Shop > Other > Basecamp.

There are new Daily Quests that are timed--keep an eye out for them! We'll be testing them out to see what a good balance is for always having something new to do. Besides that there's lots of bug fixes and balance changes you can read about in detail below.
