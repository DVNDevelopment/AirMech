gfx set uniform filterargs <int filter_id> <float x, float y, float z, float y>
In most filters (except cubic lens) x is blend between original to filter value.
filer_id
0 = no filter
1 = sepia
2 = luma
3 = contrast/saturation/brightness (y = contrast, z = saturation, w = brightness)
4 = posterize (y = number of colors)
5 = filmic
6 = cubic lens (experiment with xyzw to figure it out, z is zoom factor)
